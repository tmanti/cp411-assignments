## Q1 Curve and surface computing (short_answer)


### Q1.1 Cubic spline computing
Q:Given P1=(2, 3), P2=(3,0), and tangents at P1 and P2, P’1 = (1, 0), P’2=(1, -2). Compute the parametric equation of Hermite cubic spline passing through P1 and P2 with the given tangents.

A:

### Q1.2 Rotation surface and normal
Q:Write parametric equation expression of the rotation surface of the above cubic spline w.r.t. x-axis.

A:

Q:Write the parametric equation expression of the normal of the above rotation surface.

A:

## Q2 Curve, surface, texture, GLSL (lab practice)


### Q2.1 Curve model and rendering 

Complete? Yes

### Q2.2 Surface model and rendering 

Complete? Yes

### Q2.3 Texture mapping 

Complete? Yes

### Q2.4 GPU programming by GLSL 

Complete? No

the Angel module has a lot of errors and would never compile properly no matter which version I tried to use of it and thus could never use GLSL

## Q3 SimpleView3 - texture, GLSL, curve, and surface (programming)


### Q3.1 Texture mapping basics

Complete? Yes

### Q3.3 Bezier curve

Complete? Yes

### Q3.4 Rotation surface of Bezier curve

Complete? Yes

### Q3.5 Phong shading by GLSL

Complete? No

the Angel module has a lot of errors and would never compile properly no matter which version I tried to use of it and thus could never use GLSL


### Q3.6 My Graphics Library

Complete? Yes
