## Hand on GLSL programming

### About

This glsl_cube project contain examples of using GLSL to draw cube. 

Examples are from Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with Shader-Based OpenGL (6th Edition) Edward Angel (Author), Dave Shreiner (Author)


### Testing
 
Import the glsl_cube.zip as existing Eclipse project archive. 
 
All *.cpp programs are commented out. To test run a particular program, just uncomment the code (open file, select all, Ctrl + / ), compile and run. 

For example, test glsl_cube1.cpp, uncomment all lines. Compile and run. 

Commend out the current one (select all, Ctrl + / ), and move to next example. 

For glsl_cube4,  glsl_cube5, glsl_cube6, check the keyboard( unsigned char key, int x, int y ) function to find how to control the display by the keys.
